# Austine

I write code.  
It works.

Sometimes I design things too.

---

## What I Do

- Build web apps  
- Break them  
- Optimize them  
- Repeat  

If it scales, good.  
If it doesn’t, we profile it.

---

## Stack

- HTML / CSS  
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- React / Next.js  
- Firebase  
- APIs  
- Whatever the problem requires  

---

## Current Operating Mode

- Reducing unnecessary abstractions  
- Avoiding frameworks I don't need  
- Measuring performance before having opinions
